# Braid TODO/Suggestions
[ ] Separate logic into extended info class "StudentRegister"
[ ] Simplify `home()` logic
[ ] Add timer for reset and email send
[ ] Add writing to file to email send code
[ ] Make sure we store unique students (is name enough? is name + grade enough?)
[ ] Remove on-close logic
[ ] Don't expose email password
[ ] School schedule could also be input in a csv file?
[ ] Add logging
