check out and check in are under the umbrella of sign out.
Because time by itself is not enough to tell whether check_out or check_in should be open
When navigated to the page checks if it CAN be open based on time.
On a post request it returns to the sign_out home screen
only one call to current_page is necessary, but I included two to make the logic more obvious
